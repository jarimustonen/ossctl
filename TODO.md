## 🔄 Continue here (handoff)

_Handoff written 2026-07-25 (updated after stint #3). New agent: read this, then continue
with a fresh `/stint`. FOUR units have LANDED: `workspace-scaffold`, `contract-command`
(canonical `contract/schema.rs` + `protocol` DTOs + `ossctl contract show|validate`),
`facts-command` (`ossctl facts`, byte-for-value identical to the Python detector), and
`skill-subcommand` (`ossctl skill list|install|print` + §15-17 bundle mechanism + §17 CI
lockstep gate; first two templates wired: oss-release, oss-readiness). 101 tests green on
`main`. Now unblocked: `audit-command` (contract+facts both done), `release-engine`
(contract done), and `migrate-oss-init` (contract+facts+skill all done)._

_Stint-note (agent-death + salvage): the first `contract-command` spinoff DIED (`agent-died`)
at ~31 min AFTER committing complete green work, before its review+merge — the underlying
agent PROCESS exited (verified: orx watchdog `kill(pid,0)` correctly detected it; NOT a false
reap, NOT an orx defect). Salvaged via a follow-up spinoff (fast-forward the stranded commit →
/llm-review → merge), which caught a real floor-bypass bug (`../` escape). Filed the orx-side
gap as `agent-death-strands-recoverable-work` (orx repo, `aa9aff9`): a dead agent's
committed-but-unmerged clean work is stranded as a plain failure with no recoverability
signal. Jari is fixing that with the orx agent. STANDING PROTOCOL until it lands: on any
spinoff that settles `failed`, check `git log main..<branch>`; if clean+green, auto-salvage
(bring in commit → /llm-review → merge) rather than discarding. Parallel round #3
(facts+skill together) landed clean with NO deaths — so the ~31-min death is one data point,
not yet a pattern._

**Focus:** Build `ossctl` — extract the `/oss-*` skill family's deterministic core into
this CLI, per the three founding ADRs in `docs/adr/`. The architecture is LOCKED; this is
implementation, dependency-first.
**Epic:** [`ossctl-phase4-build`](issues/ossctl-phase4-build/item.md)
**Branch / worktree:** main (clean).

**NEXT ROUND (start here):** four units DONE. Now unblocked:
[`audit-command`](issues/audit-command/item.md) (needs contract+facts — both landed),
[`release-engine`](issues/release-engine/item.md) (needs contract — landed; large epic,
ADR-0002/0003, likely its own round), and [`migrate-oss-init`](issues/migrate-oss-init/item.md)
(needs contract+facts+skill — all landed). Only [`prose-skills`](issues/prose-skills/item.md)
stays blocked (needs `audit-command`). Suggested order: `audit-command` next (it unblocks
`prose-skills` and is the last piece of the readiness half), then `migrate-oss-init` (relocate
/oss-init, delete its Python) can run parallel to the `release-engine` epic since they're
disjoint (skill templates + Python removal vs. the release state machine) — watch only crate
`Cargo.toml` (union-resolve on conflict, proven safe in round #3).

**Hot-file learning (round #3):** crate `Cargo.toml` is listed as a hot file, but two
disjoint units (`facts-command` + `skill-subcommand`) ran in PARALLEL and merged clean — the
`Cargo.toml` dependency-append "collision" auto-resolved via union with no manual step. So
`Cargo.toml`-only overlap does NOT force serialization; brief each parallel agent to
union-resolve Cargo.toml conflicts and let them run. Reserve strict sequencing for real
shared-logic files (`contract/schema.rs`, a shared `protocol/*.rs` module).

**Read first (the spec):**
- `docs/adr/0001-founding-architecture.md` — CLI taxonomy, two-crate workspace, binary↔skill boundary.
- `docs/adr/0002-release-engine-adapter-model.md` — the release engine.
- `docs/adr/0003-config-and-journal-storage.md` — config artifact + journal.
- The locked family design lives in **homebase** `issues/oss-release-skill-family/design.md`
  (the ADRs realize it — read it for the family's *what*, the ADRs for ossctl's *how*).
- The already-built `/oss-init` unit is in **homebase** `dotfiles/src/.claude/skills/oss-init/`
  (`SKILL.md`, `SCHEMA.md`, `scripts/check-oss-release.py`, `scripts/infer-repo-facts.py`) —
  these migrate here; `SCHEMA.md` §4 is the canonical-JSON contract to preserve.

**Build order (ADR-0001 dependency-first) — the backlog is filed and blocker-wired:**
1. ~~**[`workspace-scaffold`](issues/workspace-scaffold/item.md)** — Two-crate workspace + clap skeleton + `version`/`doctor` + CI.~~ ✅ **DONE** (stint #1, commits b939fa7 → 1bb18ab).
2. ~~[`contract-command`](issues/contract-command/item.md) — port `check-oss-release.py` → `ossctl contract show|validate` (the inter-skill contract; preserve JSON shape).~~ ✅ **DONE** (stint #2, commits ee39196 → 7f07930; salvaged after agent-death, reviewed).
3. ~~[`facts-command`](issues/facts-command/item.md) — port `infer-repo-facts.py` → `ossctl facts`.~~ ✅ **DONE** (stint #3, commits 7f9fe99 → 9450b2b).
4. ~~[`skill-subcommand`](issues/skill-subcommand/item.md) — `ossctl skill list|install|print` + bundle mechanism (§15-17).~~ ✅ **DONE** (stint #3, commits 4f7e7a6 → 0103247).
5. [`audit-command`](issues/audit-command/item.md) — `ossctl audit` readiness engine. *blocked by 2+3.*
6. [`release-engine`](issues/release-engine/item.md) — plan/cut/resume/verify + adapters + journal (epic; ADR-0002/0003). *blocked by 2.*
7. [`migrate-oss-init`](issues/migrate-oss-init/item.md) — relocate `/oss-init`, delete its Python. *blocked by 2+3+4.*
8. [`prose-skills`](issues/prose-skills/item.md) — the skill-side members + `/oss-release` orchestrator. *blocked by 5.*

**Watch out:**
- **No deploy step** — see AGENTS.md "Operating policy": units land on `main`, `/stint`
  skips Phase 4. Green gate = `cargo fmt --check` + `clippy -D warnings` + `test` + `build`.
- **Hot files** (sequence, don't parallelise): workspace/crate `Cargo.toml`,
  `contract/schema.rs`, `protocol/**`, the canonical-JSON contract. See AGENTS.md.
- **Preserve the canonical-JSON shape** from the oss-init `SCHEMA.md` §4 — it is a
  schema-versioned compatibility contract; bump `schema_version` on a break, never silently.
- The prose `/oss-*` skills currently referenced from homebase move here over time
  (`migrate-oss-init`, `prose-skills`); after migration, remove the homebase copies.

## Backlog

All Phase-4 units are children of the [`ossctl-phase4-build`](issues/ossctl-phase4-build/item.md)
epic and blocker-wired (`issuectl show <slug>` shows `blocked_by`). `workspace-scaffold`
is the critical-path root. `issuectl list` for the live view.
